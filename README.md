# ðŸš€ ZKP2P Validator

This service runs on Phala Cloud and is responsible for encrypting credentials and verifying payments in a trust-minimized environment. It leverages the dStack SDK and Phala's decentralized root of trust (dRoT) to generate Remote Attestation (RA) reports and manage keys securely inside a TEE. The service can be hosted by us on Phala Cloud or self-hosted by liquidity providers. To keep the code minimal, it does not interact directly with the blockchain.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Design Decisions

- **RAâ€‘TLS & TEE-Only Operations:**  
  All communication with the TEE is secured using RAâ€‘TLS, ensuring that sensitive data (e.g., Wise API keys) is transmitted only to a verified, attested TEE instance.

- **Encryption with Phala's AppKey:**  
  The service leverages Phala Cloud's built-in AppKey (provided via dRoT) to encrypt credentials. This key is automatically provisioned and bound to the TEE, so plaintext credentials never leave the enclave. The implementation uses AES-256-CBC encryption with a randomly generated initialization vector (IV) for each encryption operation. The IV is returned alongside the encrypted data and must be provided for decryption, ensuring strong cryptographic security.

- **Remote Attestation (RA) Reports:**  
  The service provides a public endpoint to generate RA reports using the dStack SDK. These reports can include custom user-data and ensure that clients can verify the integrity and authenticity of the TEE instance.

- **Separation from Blockchain:**  
  To keep the service minimal and secure, it does not interact with the blockchain. Instead, it focuses solely on off-chain credential encryption and payment verification logic.

## ðŸŒŸ Local Development Guide

### Installation

- Run `yarn install` to install dependencies.
- Create a `.env` file by copying `.env.template`:
  ```bash
  cp .env.template .env
  ```
- Update the `.env` file with the necessary environment variables.
  - Use `.env.test` for testing.
  - Use `.env.development` for local development.
  - `.env` is used for production.

### Running the service

First, download and run the dStack simulator:

```shell
# Mac
wget https://github.com/Leechael/tappd-simulator/releases/download/v0.1.4/tappd-simulator-0.1.4-aarch64-apple-darwin.tgz
tar -xvf tappd-simulator-0.1.4-aarch64-apple-darwin.tgz
cd tappd-simulator-0.1.4-aarch64-apple-darwin
./tappd-simulator -l unix:/tmp/tappd.sock

# Linux
wget https://github.com/Leechael/tappd-simulator/releases/download/v0.1.4/tappd-simulator-0.1.4-x86_64-linux-musl.tgz
tar -xvf tappd-simulator-0.1.4-x86_64-linux-musl.tgz
cd tappd-simulator-0.1.4-x86_64-linux-musl
./tappd-simulator -l unix:/tmp/tappd.sock
```

Once the simulator is running, you can start the service with:

```shell
yarn dev
```

Then, hit the `/validator/encrypt` endpoint to encrypt your credentials:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/validator/encrypt \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "wiseApiKey": "YOUR_WISE_API_KEY_HERE",
    "processorName": "wise"
  }'
```

The response will include both the encrypted credentials and an initialization vector (IV) required for later decryption:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "encryptedCredentials": "YOUR_ENCRYPTED_CREDENTIALS_WILL_APPEAR_HERE",
    "encryptionIV": "BASE64_ENCODED_IV_WILL_APPEAR_HERE",
    "success": true
  },
  "status": 200
}
```

Grab the encrypted credentials and encryptionIV from the response and hit the `/validator/verify-payment` endpoint to verify a payment:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/validator/verify-payment \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "encryptedCredentials": "YOUR_ENCRYPTED_CREDENTIALS_HERE_FROM_PREVIOUS_STEP",
    "encryptionIV": "YOUR_ENCRYPTION_IV_HERE_FROM_PREVIOUS_STEP",
    "wisePaymentDetails": {
      "amount": "11.44",
      "currency": "EUR",
      "timestamp": "2025-03-30T06:40:57.279Z",
      "recipientId": "17123946"
    }
  }'
```

Grab the quote from the response and verify it on `proof.t16z.com`.

### Testing

- Run tests with:
  ```bash
  yarn test
  ```

### Environment Configuration

- Ensure that all required environment variables are set in your `.env` file.
- Variables include API keys, database configurations, and Phala/dStack settings.

## ðŸŒŸ Deployment Guide

### Phala Cloud Deployment

- The service can be deployed on Phala Cloud using Docker.
- Configure Docker volumes to persist data as described in the [Phala Cloud Migration Docs](https://docs.phala.network/phala-cloud/migration).
- Follow internal deployment checklists and CI/CD pipelines to ensure the service is securely deployed.
- [x] (Deployment steps to be confirmed by the infrastructure team)
